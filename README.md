Following command will run everything w/o need of installing node or anything. (it will run index.html and track changes, no package.json is required, also it doesn't install live-server globally, neither it creates a local folder with it). Run this from your frontend folder.
`npx live-server`  

For server side run:  
`npx nodemon server.js`
